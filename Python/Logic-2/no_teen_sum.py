#Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then 
#that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and 
#returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below
#and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().


#no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) â†’ 6
#no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) â†’ 3
#no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) â†’ 3
